## homework: Q1) Q3) Q4) Q5) for friday (diminishing returns paper)
---
when marginal > average, average increases.

$m > a, a -  increases$

**Short run** is where at least one factor of production is fixed.

**long run** is when <u>all</u> factors of production can be varied at once

**marginal** is the last contribution to the <u>total</u>

1) Total product will rise, when marginal product is positive, <u>not falling</u>


**The law of diminishing returns**  is when a variable factor, eg labour, is added to a fixed factor, eg capital, the marginal product and <u>eventually</u> the average product will fall. *therefore* the marginal cost and <u>eventually</u> the average cost will rise.
