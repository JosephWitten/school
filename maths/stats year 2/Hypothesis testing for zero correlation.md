The product moment correlation coefficient, r, gives an indication of the strength of the  correlation for a sample.

The correlation coefficient for the entire population is denoted by the greek letter rho $\rho$

r (sample) can be used with a hypothesis test to indicate whether there is a linear relationship within the whole population

---

To test correlation  $H_0:\rho=0$, assume to correlation

$H_1: \rho \space != 0$

$H_1 : \rho > 0$

$H_1: \rho < 0$

To reject $H_0$ (the null hypothesis), ie evidence of correlation, r must lie in the critical region

The critical values are the values that define the critical regions

---

Eg, To test the correlation between 2 variables (whole population) using a sample size of 10 at the 5% significance level (one tailed):

Critical values from the table is +/-0.5494

If the PMCC **is** in the critical region "There is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and therefore there is evidence of correlation between {variable from question} in the whole population"

---

Alternatively we may need to use p-value of the statistic r

**p-value** is the probability of obtaining the test statistic or worse under the null hypothesis

EG, to test the hypothesis $H_0: \rho = 0, H_1: \rho \space != 0$ with the sample size 20 and pmcc, r = -0.5

if the p value for this statistic is 0.0248, is the null hypothesis rejected under the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level

Working:

2.5% = 0.025

0.0248 < 0.025, ie its in the critical region, therfore there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis

## To do:
- Finish sheet
- Look at wording of answers for 1C
- HOMEWORK: New work sheet do 1,3,5,7,8 for monday
