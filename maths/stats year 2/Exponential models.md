## Exponential models

When 2 variable do not show a linear relationship, it may still show a clear pattern.

Using logs we can create a linear relationship

<font size=5>

$y = ax^n$

$logy = log ax^n$

$logy = loga + logx^n$

$log y = log a + nlogx$

lets assume $Y =logy, C = loga, n=M, X=logx$

you can then make a linear graph with the above as labels

--- 

If it is in the form $y = kb^x$ you plot $x$ on the x axis

If it is in the form $y=ax^n$ you plot $logx$ on the x axis
