# Measuring Correlation

The **Product moment correlation coefficient** is one way to qauntify correlation descriptive terms (PMCC)

The PMCC, denoted by r, describes the correlation between two variables. It can take values between -1 and 1

1 represents a *perfect* positive correlation

0 represents no correlations

-1 represents *perfect* negative correlation

if r < -0.7, or r > 0.7 is considered a "strong" correlation

PMCC can only be used to describe a linear relationship

Example:

From the large dataset, the daily mean windspeed, w knots, and the daily maximum gust, g knots, were recorded for the first 10 days in september in Hurn in 1987

**Remember to insert table of vals from book**

a) state the meaning of n/a in the table above

b) calculate the product moment correlation coefficient for the remaining 8 days

c) wutg reference to your answer to part b, comment on the suitability of linear regression model for these data


A) N/A means , in this context, that the maximum gust either weren't or couldnt be recorded

B) r = 0.9533

C) r is close to 1 so there is a strong positive correlation between daily mean windspeed and daily maximum gust. This means that the data points lie close to a straight line, so a linear regression model is suitable

## 1B q3,4,5,6,7

3)
a) r = -0.85415
b) Since r is negative and close to -1, the correlation between age and average time  taken is strong negative correlation.

4)
a) Log n | 2.363 | 1.612 | 1.23 | 0.845 | 0.301

b) r = -0.9794

c) An exponential model is a poor model to use as r is very close to 1, meaning all points are closely aligned in a line like fashion

d)
