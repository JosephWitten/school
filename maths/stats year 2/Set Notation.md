## Set notation

You can use set notation to describe events within a sample space. This can help you abbreviate probability statements. 

For example: The event A and B can be written as $A \cap B$. 

The "$\cap$" symbol is the symbol for intersection

If A and B are independent, $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P (B)$

An empty set is denoted by $\emptyset$

The event A or B can be written as $A \cup B$.

The "$\cup$" is the symbol for union.

The event not A can be wrriten as A'. 

This is also called the complement of A.
