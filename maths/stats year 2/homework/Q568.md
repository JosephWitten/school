5) Specific humidity can be expressed as the grams of water vapour per kilogram of atmospheric gas. The table show the temperature, in celcius, and the specific humidities recordded at different atmoshperic temperatures.

a) Plot a scatter diagram showing log h against t

you said not to draw any graphs for the homework

b) comment on the correlation between logh and t

Positive correlation

c) Use your answer to part A to explain why an equation of the form $h=kb^t$, where k and b are constants, is likely to be a good model for the relationship t and h

<font size=5>

$h=kb^t$

$logh = logk + tlogb$

therefore this is a good model for the data as logh is the y axis to part A, logk is the y intercept, and logb is the graident

d) The regression line of logh on t is given as $logh=0.494 + 0.0327t$ Determine the values of the constants k and b in the equation given in part c

<font size=5>

$logh = logk + tlogb$

$logh = 0.494 + 0.0327t$

$log_{10}k = 0.494$

$10^{0.494} = 3.118...$

$k = 3.12, 3sf$

$t = 0.0327$
