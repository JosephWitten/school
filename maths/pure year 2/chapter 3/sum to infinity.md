# 3.5 Sum to infinity

In a geometric series, As n tends to infinity, the sum of the series is called the **sum to infinity**

2 + 4 + 8 + 16 ..., The terms of the series are getting larger, so as n tends to infinity, S_n also tends to infinity. This is called **divergent** series

1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 + ..., as n tends to infinfinity, Sn gets closer and closer to finite value, S_infinityThis is called a **convergent** series

A geometric series is convergent if and only if |r| < 1, where r is the common ratio

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is given by <font size=5>$S_n = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}$</font>

The sum to infinity of a convergent geometric series is given by <font size=5>$S_{\infty} = \frac{a}{1-r}$</font>
