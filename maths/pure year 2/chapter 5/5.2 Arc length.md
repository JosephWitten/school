To find the arc length, l, of a circle use the formulae $l=r\theta$, where r is the radius of a circle and $\theta$ is the angle, in radians, contained by the sector.

Example 

Find the length of the arc of a circle of radius 5.2cm given that the arc subtends an angle of 0.8 rad at the centre of the circle

$Arc \space length = 5.2 \times 0.8 =4.16cm$
