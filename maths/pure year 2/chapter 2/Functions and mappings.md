# 2.2 Functions and mappings

A **mapping** is a function if every input has a distinct output. Functions can either be one-to-one or many-to-one

Mappings can either be:
- one-to-one
- one-to-many
- many-to-one

A **one-to-one**  mapping is when one value is mapped onto exactly one other value, eg on a straight line graph.

A **one-to-many** mapping is when one value is mapped onto multiple other values.

A **many-to-one** mapping is when multiple values, eg x and -x, bother get mapped to a same value, eg y. eg a Parabola

For a mapping to be a function, every input in the domain must map onto exactly one output. This includes:
- one-to-one
- many-to-one

a **domain** is the possibilities that x could be
