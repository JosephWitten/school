f(x = a) is a translation by the vector $\binom{-a}{0}$

f(x) + a is a translation by the vector $\binom{0}{a}$

f(-x) reflects f(x) in the y axis

-f(x) reflects f(x) in the x axis

f(ax) is a horizontal stretch of scale factor $\frac{1}{a}$

af(x) is a vertical stretch of scale factor a

When doing multiple transformations, work inside out
- horizontal shift
- stretch/compression
- reflection (negatives)
- vertical shift

if a question has two transformations on the x axis, eg $y=f(3x -12)$, split it up first, $y = f(3(x-4))$. Which means do the horizontal stretch first and then do the translation of 4 after
