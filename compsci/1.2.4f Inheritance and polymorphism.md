**Inheritence** is when a class takes on the methods and attriutes of a parent class

If a child class references a method from a parent class you use keyword "super" 

Class Coffee inherits Drink
    privat sugar
    private choice
    private extraShot
    public procedure new(sugar, choice, extraShot)  
    sugar = sugar
    choice = choice
    extraShot = extraShot
    super.hot = true
    super.type = "coffee"
    if (extraShot) 
        price = 2.00
    else 
        price = 1.50
