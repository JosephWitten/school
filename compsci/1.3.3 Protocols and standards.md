# Network hardware

**hubs** are devices which allow nodes to be connected together. Sent to everyone

**switch** are like hubs except they direct to specific ports.

**router** like switches but they connect entire networks instead of just machines

**bridges** are devices that create a <u>sigle aggregate network</u> from multiple networks, different from routers as routers link networks but can still be independant.

a **gateway** is a device connecting <u>dissimilar</u> networks, joins two networks that use different base protocols (translates protocols).
