## Algorithms Dijkstra and A*

Both path finding algorithms

### Disjkastra 
Weighted graph designed to find the shortest path between a start node and an end node

Node | Visited | Distance | Previous node


## A*

A heuristic approah is often used in decision making

A* focusses only on reaching the goal node, unlike djikstra which finds the lowest cost or shortest path to every node

The **heuristic** is a cost based upon estimated distance from current node to final node. it is used to speed up process of finding solution.

Node | Visited | Distance | Heuristic | D+H | Previous node

Decisions made with A*:
- Choosing which node to take next
- Shortest distance + heuristic is taken

Effect:
- All ajoining nodes from the new node are taken
- Assumed that this node is the shortest distance
