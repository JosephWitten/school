- Welcome to my presentation on communism, is it viable etc
- Before we begin I will give you each some prerequisits to help understand
- The oxford definition of communism is "a theory or system of social organization in which all property is owned by the community and each person contributes and receives according to their ability and needs", simply put everything is owned by one group of people, which is the government, and the citizens are distributed goods equally 
- The oxford definition for socialism is worded differently yet means the exact same thing.
- The man on the right is Karl Marx, who is credited as the father of communism.

- Next we have the opposing side, free marketism.
- the definition for free marketism is "an economic system in which prices are determined by unrestricted competition between privately owned businesses."
- pick out 2 people from audience and say they both sell x and one can set the price as £10 and another £10000 and they are both allowed to do it.
- The concept of the invisible hand is the idea that the market will set prices correctly and distribute resources in the perfect way if by a magic external force. It is best put by a famous quote in the wealth of nations “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest”
- The person on the old £20 note is Adam Smith the main advocate of free markets, it has been replaced by a random artist

- Lastly we have mixed economies, which is any economy on the spectrum between communist and free market, it is a more realistic economic model and is the one we and all other first world countries in

- Competition is the core to success when it comes to free marets
- ask an audience member for their favourite food, create a hypothetical we're you and someoone else are competing to sell that food product. Ask them how they would decide who to buy from
- Talk about prices, how perfect market lowers it, benefits consumers
- Talk about innovation and quality of product
- Talk about better services, convenience, the rise of Amazon
Its in the consumers interest to increase competition and competition will naturally occour due to the profit incentive

- The basic economic problem that we aim to solve is "there are infinite wants, and finite resources".
- Communism's approach is that all resources should be shared equally, however as we know there are finite resources, so how do you distribute more than you have? You dont this is why we see starvation wherever communism goes, this is why venezula made it illegal to report the cause of death in a hospital as starvation.
- Capitialism distributes resources according to the demand and supply curves, explain S&D.
