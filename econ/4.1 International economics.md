**International division of labour** a whole country specialises to create a specific and limited range

- Zambia - copper
- congo - cobalt
- UK - finance
- bangledesh - textiles
- UK - healthcare
- Brazil - Coffee
- Saudi Arabia - Oil

**Primary product dependant** countries are where a country is dependant on a natural resources such as land/crops/ores etc

**Absaoloute advantage** is if a country is better at making two (or more) goods than another country

**Comperative advantage** even if one country is better than making two goods than another country, they can both still benefit from trade if they speccilise in what they are comparatively best at (have the lowest opportunity cost in)

```
| x | Mobile phones | Televisions |
| UK | 100          | 50          |
| US | 50           | 20          |
-----------------------------------
| World | 150       | 70          | 
```

Eg to make one more mobile phone in the UK you sacrifce 0.5 TVs

For US onne more mobile phone will sacrifice 0.4 TVs

As the US has lower opportunity cost to make TVS, the US should make TVs and the UK phones


### Limitations of the comparitve advantage theory

- Assumes equal negotaiting power between both nations
- "monopsony power" + Primary product dependancy
- Transportation costs do not exist
- Factor immobility - occupational immobility  - labour/capital - lack skilled areas (theory assumes learning new occupation is instant)
- Assumes no barriers to trades, however they're are trading blocks and tarrifs
- Assumes constant returns to scale


Brazil is the 9th largest economy in the world and they did it with **protectionism**, they refused to export goods when they we're growing, which encoureged western companies to build infrastrcture, companies and plantations in brazil in order to get the produce, which grew their economy.

**vertical restraint** is when a supplier helps you and then you are restrained, eg if coca-cola, gives a news agent a fridge with huge coca-cola logo on it and say they are not allowed to sell pepsi

### Specialisation

Advantages:
- Increase productivity and efficiency
- Possible improvementin current account
- Government spending can be directed into specific areas
- Exploit economies of scale

Disadvantage:
- Over reliant on one good/sercice
- risk of structural unemployment if the output of the sector fails
- specialisation could be in a good/service that is bottom of the value chain (Primary product dependancy)
