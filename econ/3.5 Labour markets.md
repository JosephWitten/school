# 3.5 Labour markets

Input markets (for a fish and chip shop):

- Fish/chip chippies
- Financial setup
- Raw materials
- labour

Firms demand labour
households are the suppliers of labour

Higher the wage rate, the less demand for labour

**Elastic supply** of labour means **lower wages**
- Unskilled labour (more elastic)
- Capacity of labour (more available, more elastic)
- Time (less time it takes to train, more elastic)

**Inelastic supply** of labour means **higher wages**
- skilled labour (eg, doctors, lawyers, football players)

***The more indispencible the labour are, the higher wage rate they can negotiate***
