# 3.5 Labour markets

Firms demand labour
households are the suppliers of labour

Higher the wage rate, the less demand for labour

### Elasticities 

**Elastic supply** of labour means **lower wages**
- Unskilled labour (more elastic)
- Capacity of labour (more available, more elastic)
- Time (less time it takes to train, more elastic)

**Inelastic supply** of labour means **higher wages**
- skilled labour (eg, doctors, lawyers, football players)

***The more indispencible the labour are, the higher wage rate they can negotiate***

### Marginal Revenue product

MRP - **Marginal revenue product** is the extra revenue generated when an additional worker is hired

```
MRP = MPP x MR
Marginal revenue product = Marginal physical product x Marginal revenue
```

MRP = D because the demand of labour is directly related to the product they will make

<u>MRP curve for a firm (in a perfect market)</u>

![](MRP.png)

- MRP is shaped as such due to diminishing returns
- Firms are wage takers not makers, so they must accept the prevailing wage (in this graph 60)
- **Firms will hire workers up untill MRP = W** (in this graph 5)

(The MRP curve for a whole industry is a straight line linear demand curve, it is just simplified. )

The MRP is downward sloping because:
- SR -> law of diminishing returns
- LR -> Substituion of labour and capital (replaced by machines etc)

### Criticisms of MRP theory

- Productivity is very difficult to measure, thus MRP is not possible to determine (eg teachers dont produce products thus a price cannot be associated)
- Teamwork makes it difficult to measure individual productivty, thus MRP is not possible to determine
- Self employed dont pay themselves according to MRP
- Real world isnt a perfect labour market, trade unions distaught the theory.

### Shifts of the labour demand curve

- Change in the final price of the product the labour is making.
- Change in demand for the final product
- Changes in labour productivity
- Change in the price of capital

### Individual labour supply curve

Key choice, Do you work? or do you take leisure?

**Income effect** is the rise in income as wages rise but with the potential of individuals reaching a target income

**Substituion effect** is as wages rise, the opportunity cost of leisure time increases providing an incentive to work

![](individual.png)

As the wage increases there is a positive income effect and positives substition effect. *untill* a specific point in which the income effect becomes negative as they no longer care about wages compared to leisure time

### Shifts of the labour supply curve

- Wage on offer in substitute occupations
- Barrieers to entry
- Non-monetary characteristics of the job
- Improvements in occupational mobility of labour
- Overtime
- Size of the working population
- Value of leisure time
