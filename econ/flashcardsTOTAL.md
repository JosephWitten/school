What is the axis of a marginal/total/average product curve, Output and quantity of input,

when the marginal output is greater than average what happends?, the average rises,

what is short run, when at least one factor of production is fixed,

what is the long run, when all factors of production are varied at once,

what is the marginal return, the last contribution to the total,

what is the law of diminshing returns, when a variable factor is added to a fixed factor and the marginal product and eventually the average product will fall,

average returns = what?, total product/variable factor,

What is returns to scale?, the long run equivilent of diminishing marginal returns,

What is increasing returns to scale, when %change in inputs < %change in outputs,

What is Decreasing returns to scale, when %change in inputs > % change in output,

What is constant returns to scale, when you have minimised long run costs,

What is the managerial type of economies of scale, having one good manager reduces cost as they can instruct lots of labour/capital alocation,

what is the technical type of economies of scale, having efficient and inovative machines,

what is the risk-bearing type of economies of scale, exploring new markets. Country or product,

What is the marketing type of economies of scale, one advert will advertise for multiple shop locations,

what is the financial type of economies of scale, banks trust you more and you are more likely to get bail outs,

what is the productive type of economies of scale, producing more product reduces the impact of fixed costs,

what is the purchasing type of economies of scale, buying in bulk to reduce purchasing costs,

The SRAC curve shows what, diminishing returns in the short run,

The LRAC curve shows what, economies/diseconomies of scale in the long run,

What are comodities, the technical name for raw materials,

What is stepped fixed cost, when fixed cost increases vertically because the fixed capital cannot accomidate the increasing variable factor so new infrastructure/capital must be put in place to produce more,

Total cost = ?, Fixed cost + variable cost,

Average cost = ?, total cost / Quantity,

Marginal cost = ?, change in total cost / change in quantity,

What is marginal cost, the extract cost endured when an aditional unit of a variable factor of production is added,

what is opportunity cost, the required rate of return that keeps a firm in the market,

what is normal profit, the minimum profit required to keep surviving,

what two things does profit act as?, an incentive and a signal,

what is Super Normal Profit?, any profit earned above normal profit,

For normal profit TR=? and AR=?, TR=TC and AR=AC,

what does non-axiamatic mean, the curve or value will never go below zero,

what does non-satiety mean, you can never have enough of something,

what is average cost, the cost per unit,

what is marginal physical product, the change in output resulting from employing one more unit of variable input,

Average revenue = ?, Total revenue / quantity,

Marginal revenue = ?, change in total revenue / change in quantity,

When is total revenue maximised, when you have unitary elasticity of demand,

What is total cost?, fixed costs variable costs and opportunity costs,
