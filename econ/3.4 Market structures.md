## monopoly diagram
1) Draw the D=AR curve
2) Draw the MR curve (which is twice as steep)
3) Draw the MC cruve
4) Mark the profit max level of output (MR=MC)
5) Determine profit max price
6) Then draw AC cure to determine:
- super normal profit(AR > AC) 
- normal profit (AR = AC)
- subnormal profit (AR < AC)

**Productive efficientcy** is the minimum of AC, when MC=AC

**Allocative efficientcy** is when production represents consumer demand, when AR=MC.

**x-inefficiency** is when, due to market conditions, the producer chooses to endure higher average costs, (anything within the AC curve)



### 3 objectives of the firm

1) Profit maximising (MR=MC) at Q1
2) Revenue maximise (MR = 0) at Q2
3) Sales maximising (AR=AC) at Q3

**sales maximising** is the most a firm can sell whilst not making a loss


## Competition

**Monopolistic competition** is when there are lots of firms all producing slightly different goods or services

notes for 25 marker on markets:

- monopolies good for producers
> control prices
- monopolies bad for producers
> no competition, so they become compacent
- monopolies bad for consumers
> extortion

> show consumer surplus on a graph
- monopolies good for consumers
> money means research, thus inovation

### perfect competition

Best example of real perfect competion is a street market, eg fruit stalls

Perfect competition is based of 4 examples:
1) **Many buyers and many sellers**, each firm is to small to affect the price, they are price takers.
2) **Perfect Knowledge**, all information is available to producers and consumers
3) **No barries of entry/exit**, firms can enter and leave markets without restriction
4) **Homogenous output**, all firms produce identical output, there are no brands, consumers are happy to buy the output of any firm

**Hit and run competition** is when a firm joins a market and leaves immedietly as the super normal profits are exhausted.
