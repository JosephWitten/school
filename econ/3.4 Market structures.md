## monopoly diagram
1) Draw the D=AR curve
2) Draw the MR curve (which is twice as steep)
3) Draw the MC cruve
4) Mark the profit max level of output (MR=MC)
5) Determine profit max price
6) Then draw AC cure to determine:
- super normal profit(AR > AC) 
- normal profit (AR = AC)
- subnormal profit (AR < AC)

**Productive efficientcy** is the minimum of AC, when MC=AC

**Allocative efficientcy** is when production represents consumer demand, when AR=MC.

**x-inefficiency** is when, due to market conditions, the producer chooses to endure higher average costs, (anything within the AC curve)



### 3 objectives of the firm

1) Profit maximising (MR=MC) at Q1
2) Revenue maximise (MR = 0) at Q2
3) Sales maximising (AR=AC) at Q3

**sales maximising** is the most a firm can sell whilst not making a loss
