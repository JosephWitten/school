Taxes
- P2 - P1 i s *not* the tax, it is the part of the tax that the consumer burens
- The tax is the vertical difference between S+tax and S curves
- Inelastic demand means consumers are the ones who are most effected
- Elastic demand means producers are the ones who burden the effect of the tax
- The incidence of tax is how it effects each party

Subsidies
- subsidies shift supply outwards

Cost curves

Tradable pollution permits
- permits which allow pollution up to an amount
- gives a profit motive for not poluting, Internalising the externality
- environement is an example of tradegy of the commons, everyone abuses it because they dont own it.
- consequences if increase in TPP:
- -> more permissable pollution 
- -> more negative externalities 
- -> more supply > lower price > more polluting > less effective.

Monopsony power
- one buyer
- eg uk government with tanks/warship/defence contracts
- one firm buys up most/all of the output from a supplier
- eg tesco have monopsony power over local/small farms, they can force them to lower their prices
- -> either lower prices to consumer + garuntees staple foods + meets demand surges
- -> or higher profits to tesco
- suppliers have decreasing profits + horrible working conditions due to keeping up with demand surges
- suppliers lower their costs via the use of cheap labour
- abuse of human capital, eg amazon drivers have to piss into bottles
- vertical restraint
- -> eg pubs can only sell coke or pepsi, the monoposonies will work with you as long as you dont sell their competitior
- -> reduces consumer's choice
- less profits of suppliers hurts consumers:
- -> less money to invest in the product, eg less eco friendly milk, only one kind of milk, etc
