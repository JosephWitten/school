## Cost Benefit Analysis

**CBA** is a decision making tool accounting for the social costs and social benefits of a project over time toestablish a NET PRESENT VALUE (current value)

eg, cross rail, hs2, olympic games

Pros:
- All private and external costs/benefits identified
- Value judgements made as to which costs/benefits to include
- monetary values attached
- weights/probabilities aaplied
- Discount rate used to attain NPV (NPVB-NPVC) (net present value = net present value benefits - net present value costs)
- Sesnitivity analysis conducted

Cons:
- Identification (is it complete?)
- Enumeration (did you find everything?)
- Appropriate discount rate (is it correct?)
- source -> bias (who's doing the analysis?)
- Costs (opportunity and financial) 
- Time 
- Subjectivity of weights /probabilites 

## Imperfect information and Decision making

 **Lack of information**
- Merit goods (not enough info advising what is marit, thus underconsumed)
- demerit goods (over consumption)

**Asymetric Information**
- Labour markets (employer vs employee)
- Second hand markets (lemon theory)
- Insurance markets, moral hazard 

## Behavioural economics

behavioural economics argue that emotional, social and psychological factors can influence decision making. Not just maximising utlity

**Cognitive Biases**
- price Anchoring (where a specific price is associated with a product)
- Social norms (eg tipping in resteruants) 
- Availability bias (irrationally over or under inflating risk when purchasing, eg seeing an old person smoking makes you think its fine)
- Framing (being affected by the way information is advertised)
- Loss aversion -> Endowment effect (we dont like to loose things)
- Herd behaviour (following trends and conforming)
- Choice architecture (decisions based on location or placement, eg location on sale cookies at the front of a shop)

**Government policy / nudge policies**

- Framing (eg, low fat foods, low sugar, recylcing)
- Nudges (eg, placement of bins, layouts of buildings)
- Default choice (eg, organ donation, salad with burgers)
- Restricted choice (eg, public smoking bans)
- Mandated choice (eg, recycle bins, organ donations)
